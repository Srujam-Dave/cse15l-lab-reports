#1. The cd Command
- No Arguments
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
Before the commmand was run, the working directory was /lecture1/messages. When the cd command is run with no arguments, it changes the working directory back to the home directory, which is exactly
what happened. This is not an error. 

- Directory as an Argument
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd messages
[user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$ 
```
Before the command was run, the working directory was /lecture1. When the cd command was run, it changed the working directory to /lecture1/messages, since messages is a subdirectory in the lecture1 
directory. This is not an error. 

- File as an argument
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$ cd en-us.txt
bash: cd: en-us.txt: Not a directory
```
Before the command was run, the working directory was /lecture1/messages. When the cd command was run, the line `bash: cd: en-us.txt: Not a directory` was printed to the console, since the cd 
command is meant to take in a directory as an argument, but a file was written instead. This is an error - the cd command is meant to change the working directory, and the idea of changing the 
working directory to a file is nonsensical. 

#2. The ls command
