Keys Pressed: `<up> <enter>` 

The `ssh srdave@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was one step up in history, so I pressed the `up` key once and pressed enter. This command logs me into the ieng6 server so I can do the rest of the assignment
on that server. 

## Step 5: Clone Fork of Repository

Keys Pressed: `git clone <right click>`

The 'git clone git@github.com:Srujam-Dave/lab7.git' command clones the git repo with all the necessary files to the ssh server. I typed in `git clone` manually and pasted the SSH URL using a right 
click.
